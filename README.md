# 2Dconvolution_practice

Convolution2D.py contains the actual code for convolution. 
The unit test file is the test_conv2d.py.   It first checks if the output shape matches the expected shape and checks the results only if the first test case passes.
Validation code for inputs are written in validation.py
Read_input.py helps to read the input and call the convolution function.
